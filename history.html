<h1>The Story</h1>
<br> 
<h2>Chapter 1 - The beginning</h2>
<br> 
<p>I got the idea of the "Toad%" (later renamed to 6 Toad) category sometime in november of 2017 when i saw DNVIC running Super Mario 64 16 Star.<br>
He was in the HMC split and had to talk to toad for the star but instead puching him many times i laughed at this maybe too much and jokingly said "ill make toad%".<br>
So i fired up Super Mario 64 and started looking for the toad locations and i found 8 of them but 2 of them needed a certain ammount of stars to appear.<br>
The one at HMC needed 12 and the one next to TTC needed 34 so being a bad speedrunner i decided that the one with 6 toads and 16 stars became the main one.<br>
Then came the part of deciding where the run ends i thought it needed to be more different from 16 star so i decided to use the dumbest one.<br>
WDW Clip, the trick that new 16 star runners did many times accidentally became the way to end the run only because it was the dumbest one.<br>
With that idea in my mind i created a google doc file for it but im not sure who did the first run but the first three were these:</p>
<p>
1st mrlink2k 24:46.73 (EMU USA)<br>
2nd SioN 35:32.32 (N64 PAL)<br>
3rd DNVIC 36:01.18 (EMU USA)</p>
<p>According to google docs these were added 18 Nov 2017 but sadly no video has survived of these</p>
