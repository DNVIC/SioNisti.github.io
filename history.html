<h1>Story of sionTea.com</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1 - The beginning</h2>
<br> 
<p>I got the idea of the "Toad%" (later renamed to 6 Toad) category sometime in november of 2017 when i saw DNVIC running Super Mario 64 16 Star<br>
He was in the HMC split and had to talk to toad for the star but instead puching him many times i laughed at this maybe too much and jokingly said "ill make toad%"<br>
With that idea in my mind i created a google doc file for it im not sure who did the first run but the first three are these:</p>
<p>
1st mrlink2k 24:46.73 (EMU USA)<br>
2nd SioN 35:32.32 (N64 PAL)<br>
3rd DNVIC 36:01.18 (EMU USA)</p>
